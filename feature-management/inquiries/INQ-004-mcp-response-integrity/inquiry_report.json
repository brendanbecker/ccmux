  "question": "Why does the MCP bridge return unexpected/mismatched responses, and what architectural changes are needed to guarantee response integrity?",
  "context": "Despite fixes for BUG-064 (drain after timeout) and BUG-065 (request_lock serialization), MCP calls still return unexpected response types (PaneResized, SessionList, PaneContent instead of expected responses) and sometimes execute on wrong targets (kill_session killing different session than requested). This was observed in Session 18 when killing midwestmtg sessions.",
  "constraints": [
    "Must not break existing working features",
    "Backward compatible with MCP protocol",
    "No significant latency impact",
    "Prefer simple fixes over architectural rewrites"
