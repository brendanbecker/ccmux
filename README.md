# ccmux - DEPRECATED

This project has been renamed to **fugue** and moved to a new repository.

## New Location

**https://github.com/brendanbecker/fugue**

## Why "fugue"?

A fugue is a musical composition where multiple independent voices enter successively and interweave around a common theme. The metaphor fits agent orchestration perfectly: multiple agents (voices) working independently but in harmony.

From Latin *fuga* meaning "flight" or "chase" - in a fugue, each voice "chases" the previous one.

## Migration

All development continues at the new repository. Please update your:
- Git remotes
- MCP configurations (tools are now `fugue_*` instead of `ccmux_*`)
- Config paths (`~/.config/fugue/` instead of `~/.config/ccmux/`)
